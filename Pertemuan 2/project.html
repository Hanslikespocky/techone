        The park is a synopsis of Indonesian culture, with virtually all aspects of daily life in Indonesia's 26 (in 1975) provinces encapsulated in separate pavilions with the collections of rumah adat as the example of Indonesian vernacular architecture, clothing, dances and traditions are all depicted impeccably. The park mainly exhibites the physical culture of the nation. Apart from that, there is a lake with a miniature of the archipelago in the middle of it, cable cars, museums, Keong Emas IMAX cinema (Indonesia's only IMAX cinema until the 2010s), a theater called the Theatre of My Homeland (Theater Tanah Airku) and other recreational facilities which make TMII one of the most popular tourist destinations in the city.[2]

In 2007, Taman Mini Indonesia Indah launched a new logo with branding slogan Pesona Indonesia (Indonesian Charm). It received a facelift in 2023 with new flat color variations and the slogan was changed into Jelajah Cerita Indonesia (Explore the Story of Indonesia).

On 31 December 2014, the World Peace Committee recognized TMII as an International Civilization Park and World Peace Theme Park.[3]
